**Impact**: Eliminates credibility gap and provides honest representation of system capabilities.

### 2. Performance Benchmarking Framework ✅

**Problem Identified**: Performance claims lacked committed benchmark artifacts and validation.

**Solution Implemented**:
```
benchmarks/
├── system_benchmarks.py          # Comprehensive benchmarking framework
├── system_results/               # Automated results storage
└── demo_results/                 # Existing ONNX benchmarks (legacy)
```

**Framework Capabilities**:
- **Kafka Throughput**: Producer/consumer performance testing
- **Redis Operations**: State management latency benchmarks  
- **Model Inference**: ML prediction performance measurement
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Complete fraud detection timing
- **Automated Reporting**: JSON results + Markdown reports

**Impact**: Provides repeatable, verifiable performance validation for all system claims.

### 3. Schema Management System ✅

**Problem Identified**: Schema Registry mentioned but no committed Avro schemas or compatibility management.

**Solution Implemented**:
```
schemas/
├── transaction.avsc              # Financial transaction schema
├── fraud_score.avsc              # ML prediction results schema
├── fraud_alert.avsc              # High-risk alert schema
├── schema_compatibility.json     # Version management config
└── README.md                     # Complete schema documentation
```

**Schema Features**:
- **Type Safety**: Rich Avro type system with validation

- **Documentation**: Comprehensive field-level documentation
- **Registry Integration**: Complete producer/consumer examples

**Impact**: Ensures data contract integrity and enables safe schema evolution in production.

### 4. Production-Grade Observability ✅

**Problem Identified**: Only UI monitoring pointers, no built-in metrics or committed dashboards.

**Solution Implemented**:
```
src/monitoring/
├── __init__.py
└── metrics.py                    # Comprehensive Prometheus metrics

monitoring/dashboards/
└── stream-sentinel-overview.json # Production Grafana dashboard
```

**Metrics Coverage**:
- **Kafka Performance**: Message throughput, latency, consumer lag, error rates
- **Fraud Detection**: Processing latency, prediction accuracy, feature extraction time
- **Redis Operations**: State management performance, cache hit rates
- **Model Inference**: ML latency histograms, throughput metrics
- **Business Metrics**: Fraud rates, alert generation, user blocking
- **System Health**: Component status, resource utilization, error tracking

**Dashboard Features**:
- **Real-time Visualization**: 10+ panels with SLO thresholds
- **Performance Monitoring**: P50/P95/P99 latency tracking
- **Business KPIs**: Fraud detection rates and alert volumes
- **Health Status**: System component monitoring

**Impact**: Provides enterprise-grade observability for production operations.

### 5. Secure Production Configuration ✅

**Problem Identified**: Development setup used plain-text connections despite security documentation claims.

**Solution Implemented**:
```
docker/
├── docker-compose.secure.yml     # Production security overlay
└── .env.secure.example           # Secure configuration template
```

**Security Enhancements**:
- **Kafka**: SASL/SCRAM authentication + TLS encryption + ACL authorization
- **Redis**: AUTH authentication + TLS encryption
- **PostgreSQL**: SCRAM-SHA-256 + SSL connections + audit logging
