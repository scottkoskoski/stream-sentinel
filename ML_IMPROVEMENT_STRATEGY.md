# ML Model Performance Improvement Strategy
*Stream-Sentinel Fraud Detection System*

## Current Baseline Performance
- **Dataset**: IEEE-CIS (590,540 transactions, 3.5% fraud rate)
- **Features**: 170 enhanced IEEE-CIS C/D/M features (85% of selected features)
- **Models**: XGBoost GPU, LightGBM GPU, CatBoost GPU with hyperparameter optimization
- **Previous AUC**: 0.885 validation, 0.836 test (basic features)

## Performance Improvement Roadmap

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Expected: +0.02-0.05 AUC)

#### 1.1 Advanced Ensemble Methods **HIGHEST IMPACT**
```python
# Multi-level ensemble architecture
├── Level 1: Base Models
│   ├── XGBoost GPU (optimized hyperparameters)
│   ├── LightGBM GPU (optimized hyperparameters) 
│   └── CatBoost GPU (optimized hyperparameters)
├── Level 2: Meta-learner
│   └── Logistic Regression on base model predictions
└── Level 3: Final ensemble
    └── Weighted average based on validation AUC
```

**Implementation Priority**:
- **Stacking**: Train meta-learner on out-of-fold predictions
- **Weighted averaging**: Dynamic weights based on recent performance
- **Feature-based ensembles**: Different models for C/D/M feature subsets
- **Time-based ensembles**: Recent vs historical pattern specialists

#### 1.2 Sophisticated Imbalance Handling **HIGH IMPACT**
**Current**: Basic `class_weight='balanced'`
**Advanced approaches**:

```python
# Focal Loss Implementation
def focal_loss(gamma=2.0, alpha=0.25):
    # Focuses learning on hard-to-classify cases
    # Reduces loss contribution from easy negatives
    
# Cost-Sensitive Learning
fraud_cost = 100  # Cost of missing fraud
legitimate_cost = 1  # Cost of false positive

# Optimal Threshold Selection
# Business-metric optimization instead of 0.5 default
```

**Why NOT SMOTE**:
- Creates unrealistic fraud patterns between real samples
- Synthetic fraud doesn't match actual fraud methodologies
- Risk of overfitting to interpolated patterns

#### 1.3 Advanced Hyperparameter Optimization
**Current**: 200 trials per model
**Enhanced**:
- **Multi-objective optimization**: AUC + Precision@90%Recall
- **Bayesian optimization**: More efficient search
- **Early stopping**: Dynamic trial pruning
- **Population-based training**: Evolving hyperparameter sets

### Phase 2: Advanced Feature Engineering (Expected: +0.01-0.03 AUC)

#### 2.1 Feature Interactions **MEDIUM-HIGH IMPACT**
```python
# High-value interaction candidates

D1 × TransactionAmt  # Account age vs transaction size
M1 × M2 × M3        # Combined identity verification score
C4 × ProductCD      # Merchant diversity by product type
```

#### 2.2 Temporal Feature Engineering
```python
# Rolling statistics (last N transactions)
- Rolling fraud rate by user/card/merchant
- Velocity features (transactions per hour/day)
- Time-since features (last high-amount, last merchant)

```

#### 2.3 Graph-Based Features
```python
# Network analysis features

# Enhanced D1-D15 patterns  
- D_feature_combinations: D1+D2 (total account activity time)

val_start = "2017-10-01" 
val_end = "2017-11-01"
test_start = "2017-11-01"

# Ensures no data leakage from future to past
# Realistic deployment simulation
```

#### 4.2 Advanced Cross-Validation
```python

```

#### 4.3 Multi-Task Learning

primary_task = "fraud_classification"
auxiliary_tasks = [
    "transaction_amount_prediction",    # Helps with amount-based fraud
    "user_category_prediction",         # Helps with user behavior modeling
    "temporal_pattern_prediction"       # Helps with time-based features
]
```
