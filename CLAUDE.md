# Important Instruction Reminders

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.

**Project Status**: PRODUCTION-READY with comprehensive documentation and portfolio-quality presentation.
**Next Phase**: Advanced ML features, production hardening, and interview preparation materials.
**Timeline**: 6 months remaining until graduation showcase (May 2026).
