# Machine Learning Pipeline

*This guide covers the machine learning aspects of Stream-Sentinel's fraud detection system, including model training, feature engineering, and production deployment.*

## 🎯 Coming Soon

This section will cover:

- **Model Training Pipeline**: IEEE-CIS dataset analysis and model development
- **Feature Engineering**: Advanced feature extraction and selection techniques  
- **Model Deployment**: Production model serving and online learning
- **Performance Evaluation**: Metrics, validation, and A/B testing

## 🔗 Current ML Implementation

For now, see the ML aspects covered in:
- **[Fraud Detection System](../fraud-detection/README.md)** - Real-time model serving and feature engineering
- **[Project Development Logs](../project-logs/004-ml-fraud-detection.md)** - Model training implementation details
