# Stream-Sentinel Development Log #002: Fraud Detection Consumer Implementation

**Date:** August 26, 2025  
**Phase:** Stream Processing Pipeline - Real-Time Fraud Detection  
**Status:** Complete  
**Previous Log:** [001-kafka-infrastructure.md](./001-kafka-infrastructure.md)

## Project Context

Continuing development of Stream-Sentinel, a production-grade distributed fraud detection system. Following successful Kafka infrastructure setup, synthetic data generation, and IEEE-CIS dataset analysis completion, today's focus was implementing the core fraud detection consumer that processes transaction streams in real-time.

**Current System State:**
- Docker Kafka cluster operational (6 services: Kafka, Zookeeper, Schema Registry, Kafka UI, Redis, Redis Insight)
- Synthetic transaction producer generating 1800+ TPS with 8.57% fraud rate
- IEEE-CIS dataset analysis complete (590k+ transactions, statistical modeling)
- Infrastructure validated for 10k+ TPS throughput

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Core Fraud Detection Consumer Implementation

**File Created:** `src/consumers/fraud_detector.py` (685 lines)

**Problem:** Needed a production-ready stream processing component that could:
- Process high-throughput transaction streams from Kafka
- Maintain stateful user profiles for behavior analysis
- Perform real-time feature engineering for fraud scoring
- Publish fraud alerts with detailed risk assessments

**Solution Architecture:**

```python
# Core Components Implemented:
1. FraudDetector Class - Main consumer orchestration
2. UserProfile DataClass - Redis-backed state management  
3. FraudFeatures DataClass - Feature engineering pipeline
4. Multi-factor fraud scoring algorithm
5. Kafka alert publishing with delivery confirmation
```

**Key Technical Implementations:**

**State Management Pattern:**
```python
@dataclass
class UserProfile:
    user_id: str
    total_transactions: int = 0
    total_amount: float = 0.0
    avg_transaction_amount: float = 0.0
    daily_transaction_count: int = 0
    daily_amount: float = 0.0
    last_transaction_time: Optional[str] = None
    suspicious_activity_count: int = 0
```

**Feature Engineering Pipeline:**
```python
@dataclass
class FraudFeatures:
    # Behavioral features
    amount_vs_avg_ratio: float
    time_since_last_transaction: float
    velocity_score: float
    
    # Risk indicators  
    is_high_amount: bool
    is_unusual_hour: bool
    is_rapid_transaction: bool
    
    # Final scoring
    fraud_score: float
    is_fraud_alert: bool
```

### 2. Redis Integration for Stateful Processing

**Challenge:** Maintaining user behavioral state across distributed consumers requires persistent, high-performance storage.

**Implementation:**
- **User Profile Persistence:** Each user's transaction history, spending patterns, and behavioral metrics stored in Redis hash structures
- **Daily Statistics Reset:** Automatic daily stat reset using date-based logic for accurate daily transaction counting
- **TTL Management:** 30-day expiration on user profiles to manage memory usage
- **Connection Resilience:** Redis connection pooling with timeout handling and error recovery

**Technical Pattern:**
```python
def get_user_profile(self, user_id: str) -> UserProfile:
    profile_data = self.redis_client.hgetall(f"user_profile:{user_id}")
    if profile_data:
        # Type conversion from Redis strings
        return UserProfile(
            user_id=profile_data['user_id'],
            total_transactions=int(profile_data.get('total_transactions', 0)),
            total_amount=float(profile_data.get('total_amount', 0.0)),
            # ... additional fields with type safety
        )
    return UserProfile(user_id=user_id)  # New user
```

### 3. Multi-Factor Fraud Scoring Algorithm

**Fraud Detection Logic:** Rule-based scoring system with multiple fraud indicators:

**Amount-Based Scoring:**
- Transactions >5x user average: +0.3 score
- Transactions >$1000: +0.2 score  
- Small transaction fraud pattern: Calibrated based on IEEE-CIS analysis

**Temporal Pattern Analysis:**
- Night hours (6 PM - 6 AM): +0.15 score
- Rapid transactions (<5 minutes apart): +0.25 score
- High velocity users (>10 transactions/hour): +0.2 score

**Behavioral Analysis:**
- Daily transaction count >50: +0.15 score
- Unusual spending patterns compared to user history
- Velocity fraud detection based on transaction frequency

**Scoring Calibration:**
```python
def _calculate_fraud_score(self, amount_vs_avg_ratio, is_high_amount, 
                          is_unusual_hour, is_rapid_transaction, 
                          velocity_score, daily_count) -> float:
    score = 0.0
    
    # Amount-based indicators
    if amount_vs_avg_ratio > 5.0: score += 0.3
    elif amount_vs_avg_ratio > 3.0: score += 0.2
    elif amount_vs_avg_ratio > 2.0: score += 0.1
    
    # Risk pattern indicators
    if is_high_amount: score += 0.2
    if is_unusual_hour: score += 0.15
    if is_rapid_transaction: score += 0.25
    
    return min(score, 1.0)  # Capped at 1.0
```

### 4. Real-Time Alert Publishing

**Alert Architecture:** Structured fraud alerts published to `fraud-alerts` Kafka topic

**Alert Schema:**
```python
alert = {
    "alert_id": f"alert_{transaction_id}_{timestamp}",
    "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
    "user_id": user_id,
    "fraud_score": fraud_score,
    "risk_factors": {
        "is_high_amount": bool,
        "is_unusual_hour": bool,
        "amount_vs_avg_ratio": float,
        "velocity_score": float
    },
    "transaction_details": {...},
    "original_transaction": {...}
}
```

**Delivery Guarantees:** 
- Kafka delivery callbacks for alert confirmation
- Manual offset commits only after successful processing
- Error handling for failed alert publishing

### 5. Performance Optimization and Monitoring

**Processing Statistics Implementation:**
- **Real-time TPS calculation** with running averages
- **Fraud detection rate monitoring** (alerts/processed transactions)
- **Error tracking** with detailed logging
- **Performance metrics** logged every 1000 transactions

**Memory Management:**

## Technical Concepts Demonstrated

### Stream Processing Patterns

**Exactly-Once Processing:**
```python
# Manual offset management for reliable processing
msg = self.consumer.poll(timeout=1.0)
self.process_transaction(transaction)
self.consumer.commit(msg)  # Only commit after successful processing
```

**Stateful Stream Processing:**
- User profiles maintained across message processing
- Daily statistics with automatic reset logic
- Behavioral pattern analysis based on historical data

**Event-Driven Architecture:**
- Transaction processing triggers fraud analysis
- Fraud detection triggers alert publishing
- Decoupled components communicating via Kafka topics

### Distributed Systems Engineering

**State Management:**
- Redis as external state store for consumer scalability
- TTL management for memory efficiency
- Hash-based storage for structured user data

**Error Handling:**
- Connection retry logic for Redis and Kafka
- Graceful degradation during service failures
- Comprehensive error logging with context

**Configuration Management:**
- Environment-aware fraud threshold settings
- Producer/consumer optimization per use case
- Centralized configuration via existing config system

```

## Troubleshooting and Resolution

### Issue 1: Field Name Mismatch

**Problem:** Fraud consumer expected uppercase field names (`TransactionAmt`) but synthetic producer generated lowercase (`transaction_amt`).

**Error Symptoms:**
```python
KeyError: 'TransactionAmt'
# Transaction data showed: {'transaction_amt': 21.74, ...}
```

**Resolution:** Updated consumer field mapping to match producer schema:
```python
# Before:
amount = float(transaction['TransactionAmt'])
timestamp = transaction['TransactionDT']

# After:  
amount = float(transaction['transaction_amt'])
timestamp = transaction['generated_timestamp']
```

### Issue 2: Redis Dependency Missing

**Problem:** `redis` Python package not installed in virtual environment.

**Resolution:** Added redis to requirements.txt and installed:
```bash
echo "redis==5.0.1" >> requirements.txt
/home/scottyk/Documents/stream-sentinel/venv/bin/pip install redis
```

### Issue 3: Fraud Threshold Calibration

**Problem:** Initial fraud threshold (0.7) too high, resulting in 0% fraud detection despite 8.57% input fraud rate.

**Investigation:** Added debug logging to examine fraud scores:
```python
if features.fraud_score > 0.2:
    self.logger.debug(f"High fraud score: {features.fraud_score:.3f}")
```

**Resolution:** Lowered threshold to 0.3 for testing, revealing fraud scores mostly in 0.25-0.55 range.
