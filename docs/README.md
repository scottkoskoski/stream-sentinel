# Stream-Sentinel Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for Stream-Sentinel, a production-grade distributed fraud detection system. This documentation serves both as a project showcase and a learning resource for distributed systems and stream processing technologies.

## 🎯 Documentation Purpose

This documentation is designed for multiple audiences:

- **🎓 Learners**: Understand distributed systems, stream processing, and fraud detection from the ground up
- **👨‍💼 Recruiters/Managers**: Evaluate technical depth and system design capabilities  
- **👨‍💻 Developers**: Implement similar systems or extend Stream-Sentinel
- **🏗️ Architects**: Understand production-ready patterns and trade-offs

Each guide explains both the **theory** (why these technologies exist) and **practice** (how they're implemented in Stream-Sentinel).
