# State Management Architecture

*This guide explores Redis-based state management patterns in Stream-Sentinel, covering user profiles, feature caching, and high-performance lookups for real-time fraud detection.*

## 🎯 Coming Soon

This section will cover:

- **Redis Architecture Patterns**: Data modeling for stream processing
- **User Profile Management**: Efficient storage and retrieval patterns
- **Feature Store Implementation**: Real-time feature serving
- **Performance Optimization**: Memory management and scaling strategies

## 🔗 Current Implementation

For detailed Redis implementation, see:
- **[Redis Learning Guide](../learning/redis.md)** - Comprehensive Redis patterns and concepts
- **[Stream Processing](../stream-processing/README.md)** - Redis integration in real-time processing
- **[Fraud Detection](../fraud-detection/README.md)** - User state management for fraud scoring

## ⚡ Key Performance Characteristics

Current Redis implementation provides:
- **Sub-millisecond lookups** for user profile data
- **Atomic updates** for transaction state management
- **Memory-efficient storage** with TTL-based cleanup
- **Connection pooling** for high-throughput operations
