# Distributed Systems Patterns

*This guide explores the distributed systems concepts demonstrated in Stream-Sentinel, from basic principles to production-ready patterns used in financial technology.*

## 🎯 Coming Soon

This comprehensive guide will cover:

- **Distributed Systems Fundamentals**: CAP theorem, consistency models, fault tolerance
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Event sourcing, CQRS, and streaming patterns
- **Production Patterns**: Circuit breakers, bulkheads, and graceful degradation
- **Scalability Patterns**: Horizontal scaling, load balancing, and partitioning strategies

## 🔗 Current Examples in Stream-Sentinel

See distributed systems patterns in action:
- **[Infrastructure Guide](../infrastructure/README.md)** - Service orchestration and communication patterns
- **[Stream Processing](../stream-processing/README.md)** - Event-driven processing and state management
- **[Kafka Fundamentals](kafka.md)** - Distributed messaging and fault tolerance

## 🏗️ Patterns Demonstrated

Stream-Sentinel showcases:
- **Event Sourcing**: All state changes captured as events in Kafka
- **CQRS**: Separate read/write models for user profiles and analytics
- **Circuit Breaker**: Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- **Bulkhead**: Isolation of fraud detection from other system components
